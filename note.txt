2) you can create any file in ur local drive by using command touch <filename> in order to push it to your new repo, you also can  use  echo “# yourRepoName” >> README.md or any files
 3) git status //check status of your local drive
4) git add . // add all file or  git add <filename> (you can also use git add --all)
